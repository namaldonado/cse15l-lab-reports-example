# Hello World! 
## My Name is *Nathalie*! 

### A fun fact about me is that I love quokkas!

### Aside from that, another fun fact about me is that I love to build **mechanical keyboards**.
* They help enjoy typing more
* They are fun to customize
  - You can change:
    > 1. the size layout
    > 2. the RGB
    > 3. and the sound/feel

I hope you have a nice day today :)
